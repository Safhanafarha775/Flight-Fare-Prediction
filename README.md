# Flight Fare Prediction-Timeline ML Project
 Flight Fare Prediction Project
 This project aims to predict flight fares using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical flight data, the model predicts the fare of flights based on various parameters such as departure time, arrival time, airline, route, and more. The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from reputable aviation databases and publicly available datasets.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for model training.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or other regression models for fare prediction.
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- Deployment of the trained model for real-time fare prediction.

Technologies Used:
- Python for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- Libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and documentation.
- GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. Use the trained model for predicting flight fares by providing relevant input parameters.
